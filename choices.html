	An accumulation of built-in error checking and redundancy means that a great proportion of computing power is required for digital currency mining (Baecker, 2019). While Bitcoin is recognised as having more use worldwide, the value of the coin increases as well as the emissions. Cryptocurrency mining requires heavy computer power for transactions to be verified (Criddle, 2021), Being around for longer than Monero, Bitcoin generally has a greater emissions impact. An annual power consumption of 45.8 TWh has been observed for Bitcoin, where hardware efficiency and fluctuating market prices have been equally taken into account (Stoll, C et. al).
