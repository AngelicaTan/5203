	<h4><p>Introduction to our technology/topic, its significance for society and the implications it brings.</h4>
	<p></p>
	A form of digital coin is gaining traction amongst the world’s current financial systems, and that is Monero. This digital currency has potential to cut above traditional forms of payment, as its whitepaper outlines <div class="tooltip">anonymity and privacy <span class="tooltiptext">Monero XMR Whitepaper. (n.d.). The Whitepaper Database.</span></div>, sought-out benefits that rank Monero as the most private of digital currencies <div class="tooltip">(Seth, 2021) <span class="tooltiptext">The 6 Most Private Cryptocurrencies. Investopedia. 2021, July 4. </span></div>. For a world to be encouraged to use virtual transactions, an emphasis of privacy needs to be underlined, and Monero is among the best to meet this criteria at present. <p></p>All technologies face challenges with privacy, be it open-source software, the world-wide-web or artificial intelligence. If this is managed well upon a digital coin, cryptocurrency can be sighted as the next big avenue for making payments freely. Our group believes this begins with Monero.
	<p></p>
	Cryptocurrency, like that of Monero, can be seen in its place in money taxonomy. The money flower <div class="tooltip"> (BIS Annual Economic Report, 2018)<span class="tooltiptext">V. Cryptocurrencies: looking beyond the hype. Page 94.</span></div> is a visual representation of four main transactional methods where the hemisphere of Digital Currency is in blue. Within this, cryptocurrency inhabits the peer-to-peer area of transactions. This illustrates cryptocurrency as a bypass for central banks in favour of digital cash over a network. With Monero, this means permissionless transactions. This entails plenty of opportunities, and risks, which will be outlined in this report. Following these we look into how a single user chooses Monero over other currencies, and end with our individual ethical reflections.
	<p></p>
	Monero is a cryptocurrency in which all its users are, by default, anonymous. Things such as
the sender, the receiver and all transactions are hidden which leads to Monero not being
traceable. With Monero, it makes it easier to have quick and easy transactions that can go
anywhere in the world. Things like <div class="tooltip"> transactions holds, clearing fees and fraudulent chargebacks<span class="tooltiptext">Monero. (n.d.). Home | Monero - secure, private, untraceable. Retrieved October 4, 2021</span></div> are not to worry about
