	<h4><p>Our technology/topic, its significance for society and the implications it brings.</h4></center>
	<p></p>
	A form of digital coin is gaining traction amongst the world's current financial systems, and
that is Monero. This digital currency has potential to cut above traditional forms of payment,
as its whitepaper outlines anonymity and privacy (Monero XMR Whitepaper, n.d.),
sought-out benefits that rank Monero as the most private of digital currencies (Seth, 2021).
Plenty of high esteem impressions on this coin are highlighted by Renwick & Gleasure
(2021); Monero has been instrumental in the improvement of central bank digital currencies
and can be recognised for its "bespoke cryptographic schemes". Monero's blockchain is
privacy focussed, and privacy enabled with an emphasis on open-sourcing their design,
which gives the digital currency its undue respect. Additionally, numerous research
publications have given this currency the credibility it has today.
<p></p>
For a world to be encouraged to use virtual transactions, an emphasis of privacy needs to be
underlined, and Monero is among the best to meet this criteria at present. All technologies
face challenges with privacy, be it open-source software, the world-wide-web or artificial
intelligence. If this is managed well upon a digital coin, cryptocurrency can be sighted as the
next big avenue for making payments freely. Our group believes this begins with Monero.
<p></p>
Cryptocurrency, like that of Monero, can be seen in its place in money taxonomy. The money
flower (BIS Annual Economic Report, 2018) is a visual representation of four main
transactional methods where the hemisphere of Digital Currency is in blue. Within this,
cryptocurrency inhabits the peer-to-peer area of transactions. This illustrates cryptocurrency
as a bypass for central banks in favour of digital cash over a network. With Monero, this
means permissionless transactions. This entails plenty of opportunities, and risks, which will
be outlined in this report. Following these we look into how a single user chooses Monero
over other currencies, and end with our individual ethical reflections.
