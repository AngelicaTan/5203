	<h4><p>Introduction to our technology/topic, its significance for society and the implications it brings.</h4>
	<p></p>
	A form of digital coin is gaining traction amongst the world's current financial systems, and
that is Monero. This digital currency has potential to cut above traditional forms of payment,
as its whitepaper outlines anonymity and privacy (Monero XMR Whitepaper, n.d.),
sought-out benefits that rank Monero as the most private of digital currencies (Seth, 2021).
Plenty of high esteem impressions on this coin are highlighted by Renwick & Gleasure
(2021); Monero has been instrumental in the improvement of central bank digital currencies
and can be recognised for its "bespoke cryptographic schemes". Monero's blockchain is
privacy focussed, and privacy enabled with an emphasis on open-sourcing their design,
which gives the digital currency its undue respect. Additionally, numerous research
publications have given this currency the credibility it has today.
<p></p>
For a world to be encouraged to use virtual transactions, an emphasis of privacy needs to be
underlined, and Monero is among the best to meet this criteria at present. All technologies
face challenges with privacy, be it open-source software, the world-wide-web or artificial
intelligence. If this is managed well upon a digital coin, cryptocurrency can be sighted as the
next big avenue for making payments freely. Our group believes this begins with Monero.
<p></p>
Cryptocurrency, like that of Monero, can be seen in its place in money taxonomy. The money
flower (BIS Annual Economic Report, 2018) is a visual representation of four main
transactional methods where the hemisphere of Digital Currency is in blue. Within this,
cryptocurrency inhabits the peer-to-peer area of transactions. This illustrates cryptocurrency
as a bypass for central banks in favour of digital cash over a network. With Monero, this
means permissionless transactions. This entails plenty of opportunities, and risks, which will
be outlined in this report. Following these we look into how a single user chooses Monero
over other currencies, and end with our individual ethical reflections.
<p></p>
	
	<!-- Opportunities -->
	<center><img src="mining.png" width="50px"><h1>Opportunities with Monero</h1></center>
	<h4></h4>
Monero essentially began as a form of digital coin that aims to put transactional privacy first. With Monero, each transaction requires a unique ID by which only participants of a transaction are in possession of. This ID must be kept safe among other things, such as the recipient's address and the transaction key. No transaction in Monero can be verified without these components.
<p></p>
There are three layers of privacy in Monero - ring signatures, confidential transactions and stealth addresses. These privacy technologies are included in every transaction where the sender, receiver and amount are encrypted in a confidential manner. By encryption, the transaction amount is hidden. Signatures have multiple copies where all are valid and only one is real. Thirdly, the transaction is given a one time use address. Monero is strictly private and transparent transactions cannot exist. The CryptoNote protocol (Monero, n.d.) ensures all transactional procedures with Monero include guaranteed privacy.
<p></p>
The privacy layers within Monero is where it differs from Bitcoin, and enforces the benefits of the former where privacy and convenience is concerned. Other factors of privacy, such as password strength, addresses and confidentiality of transactional keys are still at the responsibilities of the user. Amongst all cryptocurrencies, the benefits all users can take is that all transactions simply require an internet connection. Funds can easily be moved from country to country. The existence of every node within the cryptocurrency network allows resilience and portability for every transaction. This means a lot of user freedom. Add Monero, and you have privacy benefits to boot.
<p></p>
An open-sourced wallet, which Monero provides, guarantees privacy, reduced backdoors and better functionality. Biryukov & Tikhomirov (2019) uses the definition of privacy as a transaction with cryptocurrency "hidden from third parties". The source underlines that cryptocurrencies are often managed on mobile where concerns for privacy are raised. In context of the privacy criteria, cryptocurrency transactions are signed and sent across a peer-to-peer network where it can be reviewed by miners. Privacy is reserved when a user is not required to send the wallet provider any information, of which Monero fulfils to its users.
<p></p>
Furthermore, banking discrimation can be avoided with cryptocurrency, as a raft of banking organisations have established boundaries on who they support. Cryptocurrencies generally alleviate this, as the payment process is anonymous and discreet so any user, no matter their purpose with the coin, can transact safely. Of course, exactly what that is can go both ways as anonymity brings opportunities for all sorts of activities.
<p></p>
Such activities include the rise of Cryptomarkets, where businesses partake in the trade of illegal goods. A survey on cryptomarket usage by Munksgaard & Martin (2020) found that vendors, small scale and large, believe that cryptomarkets are effective for business. Vendors of the survey are illegal traders of substances or drugs. A respondee emphasises "material motivations, increased security and potential profits" as incentives to use cryptomarkets for their business. Additional motivations include autonomy for the individual, financial benefits and increased security from law intervention. Additionally, the internet environment allowed larger audiences to be expected online. Ultimately, vendors agreed that "cryptomarkets reduced the risk of violence from other offenders" and "the risk of law enforcement detection". Cryptomarkets effectively mean that businesses unaccepted by society can operate under the hood with more safety.
<p></p>
Monero's blockchain network has been respected under rigorous studies (Renwick & Gleasure, 2021). Several interviewees likened Monero's blockchain design to traditional, tangible cash transactions. With Monero, an individual's transactions are veiled by the privacy and decentralisation strengths of its blockchain system. Such confidentiality has never been more controversial than its implementations upon this coin, where potential conflict on this may occur in future developments (pp. 30). This goes both ways, as a participant in the same study (pp. 27) has commented on Monero's privacy benefits, noting that some artefacts are forbidden in some areas of the world, most notably George Orwell's 1984 western literature in North Korea. However, with Monero, anyone within the country could acquire the book due to its unspied financial system.
<p></p>
The studies iterate that even semi-fungibility is technically infeasible, due to the strong levels by which cryptographic schemes operate. For this reason fungibility is an essential component for cryptocurrencies where fungibility design must deliver significant accuracy.
<p></p>
	
	<!-- RISKS -->
	<center><img src="peer-to-peer.png" width="50px"><h1>What are the Risks?</h1></center>
	<p></p>
Monero's gift of privacy comes at a cost, where this is a point of exploitation for ransomware attackers. This is becoming more favourable for ransomware gangs, with more demands for payment in Monero over other cryptocurrencies, where even law enforcement is involved (Murphy, 2021). Peer to peer networking allows users to bypass central banking systems, and this creates opportunities, turned into risks. Freedom comes at a price, and opportunities for privacy just as much allow risks against the authenticity, validity, and trust of government processes.
<p></p>
Take money laundering and fuse this with cryptocurrency, turned into real, spendable cash. This became an idea that took off in its feasibility, and quickly became a worldwide problem. Its use for illegal and unethical purposes such as fraud, drugs, corruption and weaponry became another privacy breach. Cryptocurrency revolutionised the money laundering process by which funds became easier to conceal. Albrecht et al. (2019) outlines the placement, layering and integration processes of money laundering, which has existed before the arrival of digital currency. The money is deposited into one or multiple accounts, undergoes considerable amounts of transactions, then spent into mainstream activity. Of the cryptocurrencies listed, Monero has been defined as a coin that hides its tracking records, making it impossible to trace and within money laundering, makes the currency a perfect vessel to convert into real incentives.
<p></p>
Cryptocurrencies introduce a new form of cyber attack known as crypto-mining. Crypto-mining involves a significant load of computing power, and when users want to mine in batches this often costs more than the amount of coins yielded. In this case, some users turn to illegal practices that involve the manipulation of multiple devices. This is known as cryptojacking. A user's CPU, among other processors, is exploited, where previous attempts for personal information theft ran dry. The former method became more effective. Browser-based crypto mining mitigates the expenses for the cybercriminal (Zimba et al., 2019). Cryptojacking validates the proof-of-work standard for an individual to be rewarded in a cryptocurrency monetary unit. The same method is established where a servlet is employed into a web server to mine cryptocurrency from users who visit it. Multiple computers in a crypto-mining pool need to be compromised for an algorithm to be solved and if successful, verifies the proof-of-work needed to earn coins. One general computer is not nearly enough to make the computations.
<p></p>
Where Monero comes into cryptojacking can be seen with CoinHive. Kreitem & Ragnedda (2020) investigate pool-mining with Monero and CoinHive, a service used for crypto mining based on putting scripts on the web. About 3% of most visited sites on the internet have been attached to CoinHive services (Eskandri et al., 2018). They use Authedmine which is not blacklisted, and asks users instead to respond to message boxes as a form of permission to access unsuspecting user's networks. As a surge of script mining services follow CoinHive, Illicit mining becomes more difficult to identify by anti-virus software and browsers. CoinHive enables the mining of cryptocurrencies, especially Monero, "from attention and interaction with advertisements, into computing resources and time".
<p></p>
Cryptojacking is on the rise. CoinHive was among the first of hacking script software to be used worldwide. (Carlin, et al., 2019). Many well known companies were affected in the early stages of CoinHive's use, causing a substantial amount of unknowing users and their computer's power to pool-mining. Third party services used by browsers are often breached by crypto-mining scripts. Amongst these, advertisements on a page are such an example of manipulation and as it's third party, it can appear on any website, effectively creating a domino effect of computing power manipulation.
<p></p>
Additionally, tax evasion is associated with cryptocurrency activity adding another risk for governments, potentially affecting whole countries' revenues. Millions of dollars are lost to unreported revenue. This is due to the layering process of money laundering, where the money is placed in tax havens and funds are retained, as well as further esteemed in their legal transactional history.

	<!-- CHOICES -->
	<center><img src="digital-key.png" width="50px"><h1>Choices with Monero</h1></center>
	<p></p>
	An accumulation of built-in error checking and redundancy means that a great proportion of computing power is required for digital currency mining (Baecker, 2019). While Bitcoin is recognised as having more use worldwide, the value of the coin increases as well as the emissions. Cryptocurrency mining requires heavy computer power for transactions to be verified (Criddle, 2021). Being around for longer than Monero, Bitcoin generally has a greater emissions impact. An annual power consumption of 45.8 TWh has been observed for Bitcoin, where hardware efficiency and fluctuating market prices have been equally taken into account (Stoll, C et. al).
