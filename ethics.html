	<h4>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations [Individual].</h4><p></p>
	This section outlines ethical issues of Monero, personal reflections and recommendations.
	<p></p>
	Computer ethics are integral in the production of digital services and systems. An understanding of these guidelines are crucial to guide a given technology by good values. Ethical computing components are largely directed towards “privacy, intellectual property, digital-divide, professionalism, trust, and anonymity” (Lee, 2020). Lee argues that ethical computing by the IT community is not given the serious esteem it deserves, and observes that there is a recognition for its existence but a lack of understanding for its significance. Monero and its ethical impacts can be evaluated and reflected on through relevant sections of the ACM Code of Ethics and the Software Engineering Code of Ethics:
	1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing- Monero’s privacy aspect allows all users a place in digital currency exchanging, for purposes good or bad, for better or for worse. Monero can be seen as a safe haven for people in society who struggle to find a financial bank that accepts certain users.
	<p></p>
	…
	<p></p>
	In conclusion, Monero has its many benefits, but this subjects it to ethical vulnerabilities that, when assessed, are key to understanding the effects of such pivotal technology.
