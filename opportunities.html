	There are three layers of privacy in Monero - ring signature, confidential transactions and stealth addresses. These privacy technologies are included in every transaction where the sender, receiver and amount are encrypted in a confidential manner. By encryption, the transaction amount is hidden. Signatures have multiple copies where all are valid and only one is real. Thirdly, the transaction is given a one time use address. Monero is strictly private and transparent transactions cannot exist. The CryptoNote protocol (Monero, n.d.) ensures all transactional procedures with Monero include guaranteed privacy.
	<p></p>
	The privacy layers within Monero is where it differs from Bitcoin, and enforces the benefits of the former where privacy and convenience is concerned. Other factors of privacy, such as password strength, addresses and confidentiality of transactional keys are still at the responsibilities of the user. Amongst all cryptocurrencies, the benefits all users can take is that all transactions simply require an internet connection. Funds can easily be moved from country to country. The existence of every node within the cryptocurrency network allows resilience and portability for every transaction. This means a lot of user freedom. Add Monero, and you have privacy benefits to boot.
	<p></p>
	Furthermore, banking discrimation can be avoided with cryptocurrency, as a raft of banking organisations have established boundaries on who they support. Cryptocurrencies generally alleviate this, as the payment process is anonymous and discreet so any user, no matter their purpose with the coin, can transact safely. Of course, exactly what that is can go both ways as anonymity brings opportunities for all sorts of activities.
	<p></p>
	Such activities include the rise of Cryptomarkets, where businesses partake in the trade of illegal goods. A survey on cryptomarket usage by Munksgaard & Martin (2020) found that vendors, small scale and large, believe that cryptomarkets are effective for business. Vendors of the survey are illegal traders of substances or drugs. A respondee emphasises “material motivations, increased security and potential profits” as incentives to use cryptomarkets for their business. Additional motivations include autonomy for the individual, financial benefits and increased security from law intervention. Additionally, the internet environment allowed larger audiences to be expected online. Ultimately, vendors agreed that “cryptomarkets reduced the risk of violence from other offenders” and “the risk of law enforcement detection”. Cryptomarkets effectively mean that businesses unaccepted by society can operate under the hood with more safety.
