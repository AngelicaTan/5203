Monero essentially began as a form of digital coin that aims to put transactional privacy first. With Monero, each transaction requires a unique ID by which only participants of a transaction are in possession of. This ID must be kept safe among other things, such as the recipient's address and the transaction key. No transaction in Monero can be verified without these components.
<p></p>
There are three layers of privacy in Monero - ring signatures, confidential transactions and stealth addresses. These privacy technologies are included in every transaction where the sender, receiver and amount are encrypted in a confidential manner. By encryption, the transaction amount is hidden. Signatures have multiple copies where all are valid and only one is real. Thirdly, the transaction is given a one time use address. Monero is strictly private and transparent transactions cannot exist. The CryptoNote protocol (Monero, n.d.) ensures all transactional procedures with Monero include guaranteed privacy.
<p></p>
The privacy layers within Monero is where it differs from Bitcoin, and enforces the benefits of the former where privacy and convenience is concerned. Other factors of privacy, such as password strength, addresses and confidentiality of transactional keys are still at the responsibilities of the user. Amongst all cryptocurrencies, the benefits all users can take is that all transactions simply require an internet connection. Funds can easily be moved from country to country. The existence of every node within the cryptocurrency network allows resilience and portability for every transaction. This means a lot of user freedom. Add Monero, and you have privacy benefits to boot.
<p></p>
An open-sourced wallet, which Monero provides, guarantees privacy, reduced backdoors and better functionality. Biryukov & Tikhomirov (2019) uses the definition of privacy as a transaction with cryptocurrency "hidden from third parties". The source underlines that cryptocurrencies are often managed on mobile where concerns for privacy are raised. In context of the privacy criteria, cryptocurrency transactions are signed and sent across a peer-to-peer network where it can be reviewed by miners. Privacy is reserved when a user is not required to send the wallet provider any information, of which Monero fulfils to its users.
<p></p>
Furthermore, banking discrimation can be avoided with cryptocurrency, as a raft of banking organisations have established boundaries on who they support. Cryptocurrencies generally alleviate this, as the payment process is anonymous and discreet so any user, no matter their purpose with the coin, can transact safely. Of course, exactly what that is can go both ways as anonymity brings opportunities for all sorts of activities.
<p></p>
Such activities include the rise of Cryptomarkets, where businesses partake in the trade of illegal goods. A survey on cryptomarket usage by Munksgaard & Martin (2020) found that vendors, small scale and large, believe that cryptomarkets are effective for business. Vendors of the survey are illegal traders of substances or drugs. A respondee emphasises "material motivations, increased security and potential profits" as incentives to use cryptomarkets for their business. Additional motivations include autonomy for the individual, financial benefits and increased security from law intervention. Additionally, the internet environment allowed larger audiences to be expected online. Ultimately, vendors agreed that "cryptomarkets reduced the risk of violence from other offenders" and "the risk of law enforcement detection". Cryptomarkets effectively mean that businesses unaccepted by society can operate under the hood with more safety.
<p></p>
Monero's blockchain network has been respected under rigorous studies (Renwick & Gleasure, 2021). Several interviewees likened Monero's blockchain design to traditional, tangible cash transactions. With Monero, an individual's transactions are veiled by the privacy and decentralisation strengths of its blockchain system. Such confidentiality has never been more controversial than its implementations upon this coin, where potential conflict on this may occur in future developments (pp. 30). This goes both ways, as a participant in the same study (pp. 27) has commented on Monero's privacy benefits, noting that some artefacts are forbidden in some areas of the world, most notably George Orwell's 1984 western literature in North Korea. However, with Monero, anyone within the country could acquire the book due to its unspied financial system.
<p></p>
The studies iterate that even semi-fungibility is technically infeasible, due to the strong levels by which cryptographic schemes operate. For this reason fungibility is an essential component for cryptocurrencies where fungibility design must deliver significant accuracy.
