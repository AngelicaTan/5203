	Monero’s gift of privacy comes at a cost, where this is a point of exploitation for ransomware attackers. This is becoming more favourable for ransomware gangs, with more demands for payment in Monero over other cryptocurrencies, where even law enforcement is involved (Murphy, 2021). Peer to peer networking allows users to bypass central banking systems, and this creates opportunities, turned into risks. Freedom comes with a price, and opportunities for privacy just as much allows risks against the authenticity, validity, and trust of government processes.
	<p></p>
	Take money laundering and fuse this with cryptocurrency, turned into real, spendable cash. This became an idea that took off in its feasibility, and quickly became a worldwide problem. Its use for illegal and unethical purposes such as fraud, drugs, corruption and weaponry became another privacy breach. Cryptocurrency revolutionised the money laundering process by which funds became easier to conceal. Albrecht et al. (2019) outlines the placement, layering and integration processes of money laundering, which has existed before the arrival of digital currency. The money is deposited into one or multiple accounts, undergoes considerable amounts of transactions, then spent into mainstream activity. Of the cryptocurrencies listed, Monero has been defined as a coin that hides its tracking records, making it impossible to trace and within money laundering, makes the currency a perfect vessel to convert into real incentives.
	<p></p>
	Cryptocurrencies introduce a new form of cyber attack known as crypto-mining. Crypto-mining involves a significant load of computing power, and when users want to mine in batches this often costs more than the amount of coins yielded. In this case, some users turn to illegal practices that involve the manipulation of multiple devices. This is known as cryptojacking. A user’s CPU, among other processors, is exploited, where previous attempts for personal information theft ran dry. The former method became more effective. Browser-based crypto mining mitigates the expenses for the cybercriminal (Zimba et al., 2019). Cryptojacking validates the proof-of-work standard for an individual to be rewarded in a cryptocurrency monetary unit. The same method is established where a servlet is employed into a web server to mine cryptocurrency from users who visit it. Multiple computers in a crypto-mining pool need to be compromised for an algorithm to be solved and if successful, verifies the proof-of-work needed to earn coins. One general computer is not nearly enough to make the computations.
	<p></p>
	Where Monero comes into cryptojacking can be seen with CoinHive. Kreitem & Ragnedda (2020) investigate pool-mining with Monero and CoinHive, a service used for crypto mining based on putting scripts on the web. About 3% of most visited sites on the internet have been attached to CoinHive services (Eskandri et al., 2018). They use Authedmine which is not blacklisted, and asks users instead to respond to message boxes as a form of permission to access unsuspecting user’s networks. As a surge of script mining services follow CoinHive, Illicit mining becomes more difficult to identify by anti-virus software and browsers. CoinHive enables the mining of cryptocurrencies, especially Monero, "from attention and interaction with advertisements, into computing resources and time".
	<p></p>
	Cryptojacking is on the rise. CoinHive was among the first of hacking script software to be used worldwide. (Carlin, et al., 2019). Many well known companies were affected in the early stages of CoinHive’s use, causing a substantial amount of unknowing users and their computer’s power to pool-mining. Third party services used by browsers are often breached by crypto-mining scripts. Amongst these, advertisements on a page are such an example of manipulation and as it’s third party, it can appear on any website, effectively creating a domino effect of computing power manipulation.
	<p></p>
	Additionally, tax evasion is associated with cryptocurrency activity adding another risk for governments, potentially affecting whole countries’ revenues. Millions of dollars are lost to unreported revenue. This is due to the layering process of money laundering, where the money is placed in tax havens and funds are retained, as well as further esteemed in their legal transactional history.
